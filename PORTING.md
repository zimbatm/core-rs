# Porting contract (Go → Rust)

This crate is a port of `github.com/jobs-build/amber-store-core` (Go), pinned
at commit `a2ff135cd1c94bdd04c9eca4c5019062eb4dbe81`. The Go sources are the
normative reference wherever this document or `architecture/` is silent; a
local checkout lives at `/Users/dragan/jobs-build/amber-store-core`.

## Compatibility contract

**Byte-identical** (same input ⇒ same bytes, enforced by golden vectors):

- 32-byte keys, BLAKE3 hashing, and every serialized object
  (`Blob`/`FileNode`/`DirLeaf`/`DirNode`/`XattrSet`) — hence identical root
  keys for identical logical trees.
- UltraCDC and item-chunker cut points.
- Reference records (canonical CBOR).
- Binary fuse filter sections (the Go construction is deterministic:
  `rngcounter` starts at 1; port it exactly).
- Segment footers (index + filter + trailer) given identical record bytes.
- Record **headers** and raw (uncompressed) records; wire-pack framing.
- PAX tar export.

**Interoperable but not byte-identical** (each side reads the other's output):

- zstd-compressed record payloads: Go uses `klauspost/compress` (default
  level, EncodeAll), Rust uses libzstd (`zstd` crate, default level 3). The
  compress-only-if-strictly-smaller rule is identical, but compressed frames —
  and therefore record CRCs, segment bodies, and pack bytes containing them —
  differ between implementations. Correctness is unaffected: keys hash the
  *uncompressed* object bytes.
- Segment *files* additionally depend on write order (Go's parallel writer is
  scheduling-dependent), so they are not reproducible run-to-run even in Go.

**Different, by design** (documented for the user's decision):

- `refstore`: Go uses Pebble; there is no Rust Pebble. This port uses **redb**
  with identical semantics (name → canonical record bytes verbatim, blind
  overwrite, lexicographic iteration, sync flag). A `refs/` directory written
  by one implementation is not openable by the other.

## Rules for every module

- Port semantics **exactly**, including edge cases and validation order, from
  the Go file(s) named in the module's section. Read the Go tests too — port
  the interesting ones.
- Errors: corrupt-data conditions must be typed so callers can match them
  (mirror `ErrCorrupt`/`ErrMalformed` sentinels with error enums + `is_*`
  helpers). Never panic on untrusted input; no `unwrap`/`expect` on data
  paths. Include the same diagnostic detail Go includes.
- Public API: Rust-idiomatic equivalents (`Result`, iterators/closures for
  `Emit`/`Getter`), with doc comments carrying over the Go doc comments'
  content. Getter = `FnMut(Key) -> Result<Vec<u8>, E>` style generics or
  `&mut dyn` — pick per module, stay consistent with what fstree defines.
- Tests: unit tests in the module (`#[cfg(test)]`), golden-vector integration
  tests under `tests/` reading `tests/golden/` per `VECTORS.md`. Golden tests
  must **fail** (not skip) if the vector files are missing, except while the
  generator does not exist yet.
- `cargo fmt` clean; `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean;
  `unsafe` only where unavoidable (mmap) with a `// SAFETY:` comment.
- Do **not** run `git commit`, edit `Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs`, or another
  module's files. If you believe a shared file must change, write the reason
  to `port-notes/<module>.md` instead and adapt locally.
- Record anything surprising (Go quirks ported, deviations, TODOs) in
  `port-notes/<module>.md`.

## Module notes

### `key` (Go: `key/`)

Exact algorithm per `architecture/keys.md`. `Key` is `[u8; 32]`, `Copy`,
`Ord`; hex `Display`. Canonical-length validation: first length byte non-zero
unless the length is the single `0x00` byte. `new_from_hash` truncates the
32-byte BLAKE3 digest to `32 - 1 - length_size`.

### `cbor` (Go: `cborx/`)

Canonical heads (shortest form) on **encode**; byte strings; and the xattr
map codec with keys sorted by their **encoded** bytes. Also expose the
primitive `append_head`/`read_head` helpers for `fstree`/`reference` to
reuse. Decode matches Go's actual behavior (not its doc comment): `readHead`
accepts **all five definite-length head forms**, including non-shortest ones,
and rejects only additional-info 28–31; trailing bytes are rejected. Do not
"fix" this laxness — read-compatibility with Go depends on it.

### `chunkers` (Go: `chunkers/` + vendored ultracdc)

Port `UltraCDC.Algorithm` verbatim (maskS=0x2F, maskL=0x2C, LEST=64, 8-byte
windows, hamming-to-0xAA table) **and** the driver loop from the upstream
`Chunker.Next`: window = up to MaxSize bytes buffered from the reader; the
final short chunk behavior and empty-input behavior must match
`chunkers.SplitBytes` (empty reader ⇒ zero chunks). Options default
2048/10240/65536; validate exactly as upstream (`64 ≤ … ≤ 1 GiB`, min <
normal < max). Item chunker: BLAKE3 of the item encoding, low `bits` bits of
the **little-endian u64 of the first 8 digest bytes**; `MinRun =
max(2^bits/4, 2)`, `MaxRun = 2^bits * 4`; `bits = 0` ⇒ mask 0 (every item ≥
MinRun is a boundary). Keep the upstream ISC copyright notice on the ported
ultracdc code.

### `binaryfuse` (Go: `FastFilter/xorfilter@v0.5.1` `binaryfusefilter.go` + `xorfilter.go`)

Port `BinaryFuse[uint16]` construction and `Contains` bit-for-bit:
`splitmix64`, `mixsplit`/`murmur64`, `fingerprint`, segment-length and
size-factor formulas, the `iterations % 4` segment-resize dance, duplicate
pruning, `MaxIterations`. The construction seed sequence is deterministic
(`rngcounter = 1`). **Float caution:** `calculateSegmentLength` /
`calculateSizeFactor` use Go's `math.Log` (portable FDLIBM). Port Go's
`math.Log` implementation into this module (private fn) rather than calling
`f64::ln`, so results are bit-identical on every platform; same for
`math.Round` semantics (half away from zero — use a manual impl, not
`f64::round`, and match Go exactly).

### `amberignore` (Go: `amberignore/`)

Port the matcher exactly (pattern parsing, `**`, negation, dir-only,
anchoring, last-match-wins, subtree scoping and composition). The Go tests
define the semantics; port them.

### `fstree` (Go: `fstree/`)

`Entry` with fields per `architecture/fstree.md`; encoding must byte-match
fxamacker core-deterministic output with `NilContainerAsEmpty`: integer map
keys 0–9 ascending; optional fields (5–9) omitted when empty; required keys
0–4 always present (uint for 0–3 with name as byte string, key 4 signed —
note CBOR negative-int encoding for negative mtimes); empty entry array
encodes as `0x80`. `XattrsIn` is a pre-encoded raw CBOR map spliced verbatim.
Decode (`DecodeFileNode`/`DecodeDirLeaf`/`DecodeDirNode`) must mirror Go's
acceptance behavior — read `decode.go` closely and match its strictness (and
its laxness) exactly; port `decode_test.go`. Builders: `DirBuilder`,
`IndexBuilder` (file + dir variants), children-before-parents emit order,
length-field arithmetic per `architecture/types.md`. Read paths: `ChildKeys`,
`ResolvePath`/`ResolveEntry` (path splitting semantics from `collect.go`),
`CollectEntries`, `LookupEntry` (DirNode binary search), `ListEntries`
(after/limit pagination), `WriteContent`, `ReachableKeys`, `CheckComplete`
(bounded-parallel walk; a sequential or scoped-thread implementation is fine
if observable behavior matches). `check_complete` returns the visited keys
(root first, BFS discovery order, each once; `Err` returns no partial list) —
the collector hands them to the write barrier.

### `amberpack` (Go: `amberpack/`)

Record codec per `architecture/amberpack.md`: 46-byte header, CRC-32C over
the record with the CRC field zeroed, compress-only-if-strictly-smaller
(libzstd default level), parse validations in Go's order with equivalent
error classification (`Corrupt` vs `Malformed`), 256 MiB `slen` cap on the
stream reader, magic `AMBERPK\x03`, `tagEnd = 0x00`, explicit rejection of
versions 1 and 2. Writer streams records then the end marker; reader is an
iterator that validates each record fully (including key canonicality) but
not payload hashes.

### `packstore` (Go: `packstore/`, all files)

Full port: store open/scan (segment file naming from `packstore.go`), active
segment append + recovery tail-scan (`recover.go`), sealing with footer
(`footer.go` — already-specified layouts; fanout on the **last** key byte),
sealed-segment mmap reads (`memmap2`, bounds-checked, no CRC on hot path),
`has`/`get`/`getRecord`/`storedSize`/`locate`, options (`WithSegmentSize`,
`WithSync`), `missing.go` (filter-then-index), `verify.go` (scrub), and
`parallel.go` (bounded worker pool, `seenSet` dedup, BLAKE3 verification
before commit, stats). Match fsync/rename durability discipline. Concurrency:
scoped threads + channels; observable semantics (dedup, stats, error-stops)
must match Go.

GC surface (Go: `markset.go`, `barrier.go`, `gc.go`, `compact.go` →
`markset.rs`, `barrier.rs`, `gc.rs`, `compact.rs`): the mark-set bitmaps over
footer index positions, the write barrier's grey capture (observe *before*
the dedup `has` — dedup hits must grey), segment listing/scan/record/
re-append/remove, and `compact` (seal, strict-mtime-before-horizon victim
selection, parallel re-verify + single appender under the append lock,
unlink only after durable copies). Deviations from Go's scrub-wait and
write-token machinery are documented in `port-notes/packstore-gc.md` —
Rust's `Arc`-held mmaps make Go's munmap-wait unnecessary.

### `refstore` (Go: `refstore/`)

Semantic port on redb (see contract above). Same validation and API shape:
put/get/delete/list (lexicographic), records stored verbatim, `sync` flag
honored (redb durability settings). Read `refstore.go` for exact behaviors
(missing-name errors, empty-store list, etc.).

### `gc` (Go: `gc/`)

The mark-and-sweep collector of `architecture/mark-sweep-gc.md`: mark from
the references' roots into a `packstore` mark set, sweep via `compact`.
Port `gc.go`/`collector.go`/`cycle.go`/`status.go` exactly: the cycle's
lock/barrier order (barrier on, then the roots snapshot, both under the
exclusive reference lock; `abort_barrier` on every early exit; the sweep
again under the exclusive lock), `prepare_ref`'s guard held from the
completeness walk to commit/abort, the no-op `release_ref` kept for
protocol parity, policy thresholds (0.5, or 0.1 under min-free pressure
probed at the closures dir), and the loud mark abort on a missing object.
Go's contexts/goroutines map to cancel flags + threads; see
`port-notes/gc.md`.

### `reference` (Go: `reference/`)

Canonical record codec (keys 0–5), `ValidateName`/`ValidateUser` rules and
bounds (1–1024 bytes UTF-8, `@`/control-char rules, 64 KiB signature cap),
and Decode's canonical-bytes enforcement — match `reference.go` exactly,
including whether Decode re-encodes-and-compares or validates structurally.

### `inbox` (Go: `inbox/`)

Durable receiving: entry file layout and Meta header codec (`entry.go`),
fsync/rename discipline, drain worker draining packs into a packstore via the
parallel writer, crash-recovery on open. Port `slog` usage to a minimal
logging callback or `log` facade (document choice in port-notes).

### `ingest` (Go: `ingest/`)

`Objects`/`Dir`/`Scan` APIs, options (jobs, chunk opts, xattr inline max,
no-ignore), scan order (bytewise-sorted dirents), metadata capture (lstat:
mode/uid/gid/mtime ns; macOS + Linux xattr via the `xattr` crate matching
`xattr_darwin.go`/`xattr_linux.go` behavior incl. error tolerance),
`.amberignore` loading/composition/pruning with always-store-the-ignore-file
rule, single-file ingest, parallel file chunking (`parallel.go`) with
deterministic output object stream (verify what Go guarantees and match it),
progress stats. The golden root-key test (build the VECTORS.md tree from a
materialized directory where possible) plus interop tests gate this module.

### `tarexport` / `tarextract` (Go: `tarexport/`, `tarextract/`)

Export: port the **PAX write subset of Go's `archive/tar`** so output is
byte-identical: ustar field fitting, when PAX records are emitted (mtime
with nanoseconds or out-of-range fields, long names/linknames, large ids),
record formatting (`"%d key=value\n"` self-including length), record-key
sorting, `PaxHeaders.0/<name>` extended-header naming and its header fields
(incl. mode/mtime of the extended header itself), `SCHILY.xattr.*`, dir
trailing slash, `mode & 0o7777`, devmajor/devminor, socket skipped, 512-byte
padding and the two-zero-block terminator. The golden `tar_go.tar` must
byte-match. Extract: PAX reader (hand-rolled or `tar` crate — must handle ns
mtimes, xattrs, long names, devices), restore metadata with the same
best-effort policy as Go (`tarextract.go`: ownership/xattr error handling,
dir mtimes applied after children, path-safety checks).

### CLI example (`examples/amber-store.rs`)

Dev-only mirror of `cmd/amber-store` (ingest/ls/export/restore/ref/gc,
--store, --segment-size, ref:NAME[@PATH] addressing) for interop testing;
uses only the public crate API + clap. No progress UI needed. The gc
subcommands' output format strings are byte-compatible with Go (the bench
and tests parse them); reference writes route through the collector.

### bench example (`examples/amber-bench.rs`)

Port of `cmd/amber-bench`, the ingest → delete → gc benchmark. The dataset
generator reproduces Go's byte streams exactly (Go `math/rand/v2` PCG +
`IntN`/`Shuffle`, xorshift64* file content) so both implementations ingest
the identical dataset; results.json is schema-compatible with Go's. See
`port-notes/amber-bench.md`.
