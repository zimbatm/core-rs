# vectorgen notes

`tools/vectorgen` (Go) generates every vector file in `tests/golden/` per
VECTORS.md, driving the pinned Go library
(`github.com/jobs-build/amber-store-core@e4fcb60cba49520a9ceeea266948bbaed9125837`,
resolved as pseudo-version `v0.0.0-20260727080459-e4fcb60cba49`, no replace
directive). Regenerate with `cd tools/vectorgen && go run . ../../tests/golden`
— the generator first deletes exactly the files it owns, so a rerun is a clean
rebuild.

## VECTORS.md corrections made

1. **Golden-tree metadata defaults.** The tree table left the root entries'
   mtimes (and the `sub`/`bigdir` directory entries' mtimes) unstated. The
   generator uses zero for every unstated metadata field; VECTORS.md now says
   so explicitly ("Any metadata field not stated is zero"). Without this the
   Rust builder could not reproduce the root key.
2. **Xattr spill rule source.** VECTORS.md pointed at `ingest/meta.go`; the
   rule actually lives in `ingest/driver.go` (`buildEntry`):
   `len(cborx.EncodeXattrs(m)) <= xattrInlineMax` (default 256) keeps the map
   inline, else it spills to an `XattrSet`. The threshold and ≤-comparison in
   VECTORS.md were already correct; only the file reference was fixed.
3. **amberignore check semantics.** The vector needs a defined answer for
   paths *under* an ignored directory. VECTORS.md now states the evaluation
   walk the generator (and the Rust test) must use — the ingest walk: an
   ignored ancestor directory prunes the subtree (path reports ignored, no
   re-inclusion below it); otherwise the final component's
   `Ignored(name, is_dir)` result is recorded.

## segments_go method

No crash simulation was needed. In the Go packstore, sealing happens **only**
when an append pushes the active segment to/past the size threshold
(`Store.append` → `sealActiveLocked`); `Store.Close` fsyncs and closes the
active segment **without sealing it** (`packstore.go`). So the generator:

1. `packstore.Open(dir, WithSegmentSize(65536), WithSync(false))`.
2. Sequentially `Put`s deterministic blob objects (mix of incompressible
   splitmix and compressible const payloads) until the directory holds two
   sealed `*.seg` files (checked by listing after each Put).
3. `Put`s three small tail objects — these create the third segment and stay
   far below 65536 bytes.
4. `Close`s the store, leaving `0000000000000003.seg.active` with a valid
   header + records and **no footer** — byte-identical to the "killed before
   seal" state VECTORS.md describes. Post-conditions asserted: exactly 2
   sealed + 1 active, active larger than the 8-byte header, no trailer magic
   at its end.

Sequential single-threaded `Put`s make the segment bytes a pure function of
the object sequence, so the whole directory is deterministic (the footer's
index/filter sections are order-independent by construction; zstd frames are
deterministic for the pinned `klauspost/compress` version).

## Other notes

- `records_raw.json`: the generator asserts flag byte == 0 for every case
  (splitmix payloads never win against zstd, including the empty payload);
  `records_compressed.json` asserts flag == 1.
- `filters.json` re-implements packstore's unexported `buildFilterSection`
  layout verbatim (type byte 0x01, BE seed/geometry/count, BE u16
  fingerprints) over `u64s(seed, n)` deduplicated + sorted.
- The golden tree is built via `chunkers.SplitBytes` → `fstree.EncodeBlob` →
  `fstree.NewFileIndexBuilder` (which returns a single chunk's blob key
  unwrapped, exactly like ingest) and `fstree.NewDirBuilder` over
  bytewise-name-sorted entries; empty files emit the empty Blob, mirroring
  `ingest/driver.go buildFile`.
- Verification performed after generation (throwaway program, since deleted):
  `objects.bin` keys parse canonically and their hash tails match
  BLAKE3(bytes); `pack_go.bin` stream-decodes to exactly the manifest objects
  in manifest order with a clean end marker; `pack_empty.bin` decodes to zero
  objects; a copy of `segments_go/` opens, serves all 31 manifest objects
  byte-exactly, and reports the 4 absent keys missing.
- Determinism check: generated twice into two scratch dirs; `diff -r` showed
  both runs identical to each other **and** to the committed
  `tests/golden/` output. JSON is emitted from structs only (fixed field
  order), never maps.
