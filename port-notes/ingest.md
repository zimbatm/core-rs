# ingest port notes

Go sources: `ingest/ingest.go`, `driver.go`, `parallel.go`, `scan.go`,
`meta.go`, `xattr_common.go`, `xattr_darwin.go`, `xattr_linux.go` (pinned
`e4fcb60`). Rust: `src/ingest/{mod,driver,parallel,scan,meta,xattrs}.rs`,
tests in `src/ingest/tests.rs` (full Go-test port) and `tests/ingest.rs`
(public-surface integration). Dev CLI: `examples/amber-store.rs`.

## API mapping

| Go | Rust |
|----|------|
| `Objects(path, opts) (iter.Seq2[Object,error], *key.Key, error)` | `objects(path, opts) -> Result<(ObjectStream, Root), Error>` — the stream is an `Iterator<Item = Result<fstree::Object, Error>>`; `Root::get()` returns `Some` only after a complete, error-free drain, mirroring the late-filled `*key.Key`. Dropping the stream early cancels the build (Go: `yield` returning false → context cancel). |
| `Dir(st, path, opts) (key.Key, WriteStats, error)` | `dir(st, path, opts) -> (WriteStats, Result<Key, Error>)` — stats are reported even for erroring runs, like Go's triple. |
| `Scan(dir, noIgnore, jobs) (int64, int64, error)` | `scan(dir, no_ignore, jobs) -> Result<(u64, u64), Error>` (sizes can't be negative; Go uses int64 only because `FileInfo.Size` does). |
| `Progress` interface | `trait Progress: Send + Sync`, carried as `Option<Arc<dyn Progress>>` in `Opts`. |
| `Opts.Jobs int` (<1 ⇒ GOMAXPROCS) | `jobs: usize` (0 ⇒ `available_parallelism`). Negative values are unrepresentable. |
| `ChunkOpts.ItemBits int` | `item_bits: u32` (a negative bit width was never usable). |
| `errStopped` | `Error::Stopped` — public in the enum but never returned by the public API; the producer filters it exactly as `objects` filters `errStopped`. |

One `Error` enum covers the whole package (Go returns untyped `error`s).
Filesystem failures carry `op path: cause` like `*fs.PathError`;
chunker-option and fstree errors pass through transparently. `dir()`
additionally unwraps a build error that traveled through
`write_parallel` as `packstore::Error::Source` (via downcast), so callers see
the same error Go's `Dir` returns; genuine store failures surface as
`Error::Store`.

## Ordering contract (parallel.go, read carefully)

What Go guarantees — and what this port reproduces exactly:

- **Stream order is unspecified overall**: sibling subtrees emit into the
  shared channel concurrently, so interleaving is scheduling-dependent
  (`Objects` doc: "Object order is unspecified").
- **Per-file chunk order is preserved**: one worker chunks a file
  sequentially, emitting Blob then FileNode levels bottom-up.
- **Per-directory determinism**: `pbuilder.buildDir` waits for all kept
  entries (WaitGroup ↔ `thread::scope`), then assembles DirLeaf/DirNode
  objects **in sorted-entry order** on one thread — identical objects and
  keys to the sequential walk. The first error **in entry order** wins (not
  chronologically), checked before each `AddEntry`, as in Go.
- **Children before parents; the root is the last object emitted.**
- Worker offload uses a non-blocking semaphore acquire with inline fallback
  (Go: non-blocking channel send), so a parent never waits on a slot held by
  a descendant — ported as an `AtomicUsize` try-acquire.
- Buffered channel of `jobs*2` between build and consumer (same constant).

Every key (and the root) is therefore a deterministic function of the source
tree and the chunk options; `dir_writes_to_packstore` asserts root equality
across jobs=1 and jobs=8, and the parity tests compare the full object set
against the sequential oracle.

## Metadata capture

- `lstat` via `std::fs::symlink_metadata` + `MetadataExt`: raw `st_mode`
  (u64), uid, gid, `mtime*1e9 + mtime_nsec` with wrapping arithmetic
  (`Time.UnixNano` overflows the same way).
- Type dispatch on `st_mode & S_IFMT` with libc constants (values match
  x/sys/unix on Linux and Darwin). Unsupported types render Go's `%#o`
  (`0140000`-style).
- Device numbers: hand-ported x/sys/unix `Major`/`Minor` for Linux
  (gnu_dev_major/minor) and Darwin (`>>24 & 0xff` / `& 0xffffff`), i.e. the
  exact functions Go calls — not the local C macros.
- Symlink targets via `read_link`, raw bytes (no UTF-8 assumption anywhere:
  names and targets are `Vec<u8>` end to end).

## Xattrs

- Darwin uses the follow variants (`Listxattr`/`Getxattr`), Linux the
  no-follow variants (`Llistxattr`/`Lgetxattr`); mirrored with the `xattr`
  crate's plain vs `_deref` functions. Only ever called on non-symlinks, so
  the distinction is unobservable — kept for fidelity.
- Error tolerance matches Go: any list/get failure aborts the build; empty
  names in the list are dropped (`splitXattrNames`); an attribute that
  vanishes between list and get is turned back into ENODATA/ENOATTR (the
  crate maps it to `None`).
- One unobservable-in-practice difference: Go's two-call size-probe errors
  with ERANGE if a value *grows* between the calls; the crate retries the
  fetch instead. Rust is strictly more tolerant in that race; keys are
  unaffected.
- Spill rule ported exactly: inline iff `len(encode_xattrs(m)) <=
  xattr_inline_max`, else an emitted `XattrSet` object referenced by key 9.
  Sorting by *encoded* key bytes lives in `cbor::encode_xattrs` (already
  golden-tested).

## Scan

Same fan-out pattern as the build (non-blocking semaphore, inline fallback,
per-directory join). First error is recorded and the walk continues (Go has
no cancellation there either); `.amberignore` filtering is applied exactly as
the build applies it, including `d_type`-based `is_dir` for the ignore check
and lstat-based dispatch afterwards.

## Sequential walk

`Driver::build_dir` (Go `driver.buildDir`) has no production caller — Go's
`Objects` always uses `pbuilder` for directories — but it is the reference
oracle for the parity tests, so it stays compiled (`#[allow(dead_code)]`
with a comment) rather than being test-gated.

## Golden vectors

There are no ingest-specific files under `tests/golden/`, and the VECTORS.md
golden tree cannot be materialized unprivileged (fixed uid/gid 1000, device
nodes, sockets), so there is no golden root-key test built from a
materialized directory. The gates are instead: the full ported Go test suite
(sequential/parallel parity, pruned-tree amberignore oracle, packstore
round-trip, progress totals) plus differential interop against the Go CLI
(below). The existing `tests/golden/fstree` tree continues to cover the
builder/codec byte-compatibility that ingest rides on.

## Dev CLI (`examples/amber-store.rs`)

Mirrors `cmd/amber-store` minus the progress UI (a hidden no-op
`--no-progress` keeps command lines interchangeable). Same store layout
(`<dir>/packstore`, `<dir>/refs`), `--store` / `$AMBER_STORE`, spec grammar
`KEY[/PATH]` | `ref:NAME[@PATH]`, chunk-flag semantics (defaults
32Ki/128Ki/256Ki are *set* values; all-zero selects library defaults;
partial zeros error), `ls -l` rendering (mode string, device `maj,min`
sizes, key-length sizes, `Jan _2 15:04` vs `Jan _2  2006` with the six-month
cutoff computed via `localtime_r`/`mktime` standing in for
`now.AddDate(0,-6,0)`), `ref` subcommands with RFC3339-UTC list output, and
byte-identical PAX export. Differences:

- `restore` spools the tar through an unlinked temp file instead of an
  in-process pipe: the workspace toolchain floor (rustc 1.86) predates
  `std::io::pipe`. Memory stays flat; an export error surfaces before
  extraction begins, like the Go pipe's `CloseWithError`.
- Argument arity/usage errors come from clap instead of hand-rolled checks;
  store/spec/resolution errors print as `amber-store: <err>` with exit 1,
  matching Go's shape.
- Entry names/symlink targets are written to stdout as raw bytes, exactly as
  Go's `%s` on byte-backed strings.

## Interop verification (Go CLI ↔ Rust CLI, macOS)

Fresh stores per side, same source trees; root keys printed by
`go run ./cmd/amber-store ingest` and the Rust example were **identical** in
every case:

- mixed tree (multi-chunk 700 KiB file, empty file, symlink, fifo, nested
  `.amberignore` composition incl. negation/dir-only/pruning, inline xattr,
  mode 600): `220af4…214e`, and `ls` / `ls --keys` / `export` output
  byte-identical (`diff`/`cmp`); restore round-trip verified (contents,
  symlink, fifo, mode 600, xattr, pruned entries absent).
- spilled xattr (400 B > 256), xattr on a directory, setuid + sticky bits:
  parity, also at `-j 1`.
- custom options `--min 1024 --avg 4096 --max 16384 --item-bits 3
  --xattr-inline-max 64`: parity.
- single-file ingest (300 KiB): parity.
- unix socket entry, dangling symlink, pre-1970 mtime: parity, `ls`
  rendering (incl. `Jun  1  1969`) identical.

All scratch trees/stores lived under `/tmp/amber-interop` and were deleted;
the Go checkout was only read (`go run` from its own directory).

## Go PR #3 backport (2026-08-27)

ENOTSUP/EOPNOTSUPP from the xattr *list* call now means "no xattrs" (a
filesystem without xattr support), as in tar and rsync; get errors still
abort. Go refactored to an injectable `readXattrsWith(list, get)` for
testability; the port mirrors that as `read_xattrs_with` over the `xattr`
crate's closure shapes (an iterator-returning `list` instead of Go's
two-call size/fill protocol — the crate owns that dance).
