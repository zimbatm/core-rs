# Data Types

This document describes **what** kinds of data the Amber-Store holds and how they
model a filesystem tree. The concrete on-the-wire encoding of each type — and how
objects combine into files and directories — lives in [fstree.md](fstree.md).

Every piece of content is identified by a 32-byte [lookup key](keys.md). The key's
header byte carries a **4-bit type** field; this document defines what those types
mean.

## Two type namespaces

Keep these separate — it is the foundation of the whole model:

1. **CAS object type** — the 4-bit field in the key header ([keys.md](keys.md)).
   It tells a reader what kind of object a key points to (raw bytes, a file index,
   a directory leaf, …). Readers dispatch on this.
2. **Filesystem entry type** — the POSIX `st_mode` file type
   (regular / directory / symlink / character / block / fifo / socket). This lives
   **inside a directory entry's metadata**, because symlinks and special files have
   **no CAS object at all**: their data is stored inline in the parent directory.

A regular-file or subdirectory entry holds a **content key** (and that key's header
reveals whether it is a `Blob`, `FileNode`, `DirLeaf`, or `DirNode`). A symlink,
device, fifo, or socket entry holds its small data **inline** and references no key.

## CAS object types

The 4-bit type field has 16 slots; 5 are defined.

| Type | Name       | Role                                                              | Key length field encodes        | Child object types   |
|------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| 0    | `Blob`     | Raw file-content byte chunk (a CDC leaf). A single-chunk file *is* one `Blob`. | own serialized byte length      | —                    |
| 1    | `FileNode` | File chunk-index node, keyed by byte offset (file content tree).  | **total file content bytes (= file size)** | `FileNode` / `Blob`  |
| 2    | `DirLeaf`  | A contiguous run of complete directory entries (prolly-tree leaf).| **own bytes + subtree footprint** | (entries are inline) |
| 3    | `DirNode`  | Directory index node, keyed by entry name (directory tree).      | **own bytes + subtree footprint** | `DirNode` / `DirLeaf`|
| 4    | `XattrSet` | Spilled extended attributes, when too large to store inline.     | own serialized byte length      | —                    |
| 5–15 | reserved   | Must not be emitted.                                             | —                               | —                    |

**Leaf and internal nodes are distinct types** (`Blob`/`FileNode`,
`DirLeaf`/`DirNode`) so the key alone tells a reader whether following it yields
data or more index — no fetch-then-discriminate. With 11 free slots this costs
nothing.

## Length field: logical size, not serialized size

The key's hash always covers the object's **serialized bytes**. The key's
**length field**, however, carries a *logical* size for the aggregate types — this
extends the rule [keys.md](keys.md) already states for directories:

- `Blob`, `XattrSet`: length = the object's own serialized byte length.
- `FileNode`: length = total bytes of the file region it covers — i.e. the file's
  **content size**, *excluding* this node's own index bytes. This buys **O(1)
  `stat`** (a file's size is read from the `contentKey` already inline in its parent
  `DirLeaf`, with no file fetch) and **O(log n) random-access seek** (each child
  key's length is exactly the content span it covers).
- `DirLeaf`, `DirNode`: length = **own serialized bytes + the cumulative length of
  every child** → a true `du`-style footprint of the directory subtree, in O(1) from
  any node.

For directories the cumulative therefore counts, across the whole subtree: every
regular file's content bytes, every directory object's (`DirLeaf`/`DirNode`) own
serialized bytes, and every spilled `XattrSet`'s bytes. It does **not** count
`FileNode` index bytes — those belong to the file, whose key exposes only its
content size. Concretely:

- `DirNode.length` = own serialized bytes + Σ `childKey.length`.
- `DirLeaf.length` = own serialized bytes + Σ over entries of `contentKey.length`
  (for `S_IFREG`/`S_IFDIR`) + `xattrsKey.length` (for entries with spilled xattrs).
  Symlinks, devices, fifos, and sockets add nothing beyond the `DirLeaf`'s own bytes,
  which already include their inline data.

## Filesystem entry types

A directory entry's metadata includes the full POSIX `st_mode`, whose high bits
(`S_IFMT`) give the entry type. The type determines where the entry's payload
lives:

| Entry type        | `S_IFMT`   | Payload                                   |
|-------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| regular file      | `S_IFREG`  | content key → `Blob` or `FileNode`        |
| directory         | `S_IFDIR`  | content key → `DirLeaf` or `DirNode`      |
| symbolic link     | `S_IFLNK`  | inline target path                        |
| character device  | `S_IFCHR`  | inline `rdev` (major, minor)              |
| block device      | `S_IFBLK`  | inline `rdev` (major, minor)              |
| fifo              | `S_IFIFO`  | none                                      |
| socket            | `S_IFSOCK` | none                                      |

Each entry also carries `uid`, `gid`, `mtime`, and optional extended attributes.
File **size** is *not* stored in the entry — it is read from the content key's
length field, avoiding duplication.

## The directory model

A directory is a **prolly tree**: a map from entry name → entry, sorted by name and
split into CAS objects by content-defined chunking applied **at entry boundaries**
(an entry is never split across objects). `DirLeaf` objects hold runs of entries;
`DirNode` objects index child subtrees by name.

This gives the project's primary goal — large directories (>100K entries) processed
with **less than O(n) memory**:

- **Lookup** of one name: O(log n) object fetches, each O(fanout) memory.
- **Ordered iteration** (`readdir`): stream leaves left-to-right, holding one
  root-to-leaf path at a time.
- **Mutation** of one entry: re-chunk the affected leaf and re-index the O(log n)
  objects on its path; the rest is structurally shared with — and deduplicated
  against — the prior tree.

A directory whose entries fit in a single chunk has a `DirLeaf` root; a larger one
has a `DirNode` root. The parent entry stores only the root key; its header type
discriminates.

## The file model

A regular file's content is split into chunks by content-defined chunking. Each
chunk is a `Blob`. A single-chunk file *is* one `Blob`; a larger file gets a
`FileNode` index whose child-reference stream is itself CDC-chunked, producing
multiple levels so even multi-GB files keep an O(log n) index and O(log n)
random-access seek. Every file — even one byte — is its own CAS object (no
inlining of file content into the directory entry), keeping the model uniform.

## Root directory metadata

The top of a store is simply a directory key (`DirLeaf` or `DirNode`). Because
entry metadata lives in the *parent* entry, the **root directory carries no
metadata of its own** for now — whatever external reference names the root key can
hold root ownership/mode/mtime later if needed. Snapshot/versioning objects are
intentionally out of scope at this stage.
